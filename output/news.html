    <a class="headerlink" href="#cve-2024-31391-solr-operator-liveness-and-readiness-probes-may-leak-basic-auth-credentials" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong><br>
Moderate</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong><br>
Solr Operator 0.3.0 to 0.8.0</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.</p>
<p>The Solr sked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the "solr" and "admin" accounts for use by end-users, and a "k8s-oper" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes "event" containing the username and password of the "k8s-oper" account.</p>
<p>Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the <code>.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic</code> option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting <code>.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting <code>.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false</code>.</p>

  <p><strong>Severity:</strong><br>
Moderate</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2</li>
<li>Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.3.0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.</p>
<p>This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.</p>
<p>This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".</p>
<p>Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:<br>
<code>-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=".*(password|secret|basicauth).*"</code></p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3, 9.3.0 or later, which has consistent systemProperty redaction logic.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.</p>
<p>This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.</p>
<p>The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.
However, when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
External library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.
Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3, 9.3.0 or later.</p>

An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,
then send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in "zkHost".
Streaming Expressions are exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs when connecting.</p>

  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong><br>
Moderate</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2</li>
<li>Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.4.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.</p>
<p>In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.
When backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).
If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.</p>
<p>When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
In these versions, the following protections have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.</li>
<li>The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Severity:</strong><br>
Important</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong><br>
Solr 9.0 to 9.2.1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.
The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance.
Users are able to specify which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system properties.
Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set per-Java-process.</p>
<p>The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not published via the Metrics API.</p>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#apache-solr-is-vulnerable-to-cve-2022-39135-via-sql-handler" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong><br>
Solr 6.5 to 8.11.2
Solr 9.0</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Apache Calcite has a vulnerability, CVE-2022-39135, that is exploitable in Apache Solr in SolrCloud mode.  If an untrusted user can supply SQL queries to Solr’s “/sql” handler (even indirectly via proxies / other apps), then the user could perform an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.  This might have been exposed by some deployers of Solr in order for internal analysts to use JDBC based tooling, but would have unlikely been granted to wider audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
An XXE attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery (SSRF), port scanning from the Solr node, and other system impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Most Solr installations don’t make use of the SQL functionality.  For such users, the standard Solr security advice of using a firewall should be adequate.  Nonetheless, the functionality can be disabled.  As of Solr 9, it has been modularized and thus became opt-in, so nothing is needed for Solr 9 users that don’t use it.  Users <em>not</em> using SolrCloud can’t use the functionality at all.  For other users that wish to disable it, you must register a request handler that masks the underlying functionality in solrconfig.xml like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  &lt;requestHandler name=&quot;/sql&quot; class=&quot;solr.NotFoundRequestHandler&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Users needing this SQL functionality are forced to upgrade to Solr 9.1.  If Solr 8.11.3 is released, then it will be an option as well.  Simply replacing Calcite and other JAR files may mostly work but could fail depending on the particulars of the query.  Users interested in this or in patching their own versions of Solr should examine SOLR-16421 for a source patch.</p>

  <p>Several users running Solr in production on OpenJDK 17 have experienced JVM crashes due to a known bug in the JDK. Read more about the bug in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16463">SOLR-16463</a>.</p>
<p>Known mitigations are to either downgrade to JDK 11 or to start Solr with a Java startup flag that avoids the failure condition. Here is how to manually apply the flag:</p>
<p>Edit your <code>solr.in.sh</code> or <code>solr.in.cmd</code> file to set the <code>SOLR_OPTS</code> environment variable as follows:</p>
<p><em>Linux:</em> </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">SOLR_OPTS</span><span class="o">=</span>-XX:CompileCommand<span class="o">=</span>exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Windows:</em></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>SET<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">SOLR_OPTS</span><span class="o">=</span>-XX:CompileCommand<span class="o">=</span>exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can inject the same flag with the <code>-a</code> argument, e.g:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>bin/solr<span class="w"> </span>-a<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you run Solr 9 with the official Docker image, we have already pushed an updated Docker image to Docker Hub that will inject the flag for you.
Just pull the image again to get it.
The Docker image uses the <code>-a</code> option to set this java flag when running Solr, so if you are using the

    <a class="headerlink" href="#solr-8-docker-image-changes-to-eclipse-temurin-jdk" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p>The official docker image for Solr 8.11 has been running on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk">Oracle OpenJDK 11 JRE</a>. However, due to Oracle's new release policies, they now no longer provide support for JDK11. Since Solr 8.11 is still being supported by the Apache Solr project, we needed to switch to another OpenJDK vendor with JDK11 support. We chose <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin">Eclipse Temurin</a> from the Adoptium project. This is the same vendor as we use for our Solr 9 image, and their <a href="https://adoptium.net/support/">JDK11 support lasts until October 2024</a>. </p>
<p>Users should be aware that on your next <code>docker pull solr:8.11.2</code> you will be upgraded. For most users there will be no issues, as it is mainly a new distribution of the same upstream OpenJDK version. However, if you use our image as base image and rely on specific tools to be present, you may need to adapt. While <code>openjdk:11-jre</code> uses <code>Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)</code>, the <code>eclipse-temurin:11-jre-focal</code> image uses <code>Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is now no difference between the <code>solr:11-jre</code> and <code>solr:11-jre-slim</code> images, because our new vendor only offers one variant which is fairly slim already.</p>
  <h2 id="solr-docker-images-now-pin-the-linux-release">20 October 2022, Solr Docker images now pin the Linux release
    <a class="headerlink" href="#solr-docker-images-now-pin-the-linux-release" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p>Solr 9 was released on May 12th, using the <code>eclipse-temurin:17-jre</code> base image. Thus, we are pinned to Java 17 and Solr's
Docker image will thus always use an updated Java 17 version. If you pull the docker image from time to time that is.</p>
<p>However, the base image tag <code>17-jre</code> did not give us pinning to a specific Ubuntu Linux major release. 
At the time of <a href="http://localhost:8000/news.html#apache-solrtm-900-available">Solr 9 release</a> on May 12th
it would pull Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa), but at the end of May, it was <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/commit/6d689db4846a3eb4c2ebd0e5d06139c650ef3bbb">auto upgraded</a> to the brand new Ubuntu
22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish). This was not our desire, and we have learnt that due to this, our image is no longer compatible
with Docker client versions before 20.10.16. Having a "floating" linux release like this can also break the image in 
other subtle ways, as well as breaking downstream images using us as a base image.</p>
<p>We therefore decided to start pinning not only Java release, but also Linux release in our official Docker images.
This means that Solr 9.0 is once again based on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, i.e. a downgrade.</p>
<p>Note that our images will still receive important Linux bug fixes from time to time, but you won't get them unless you
re-pull the image. When we upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 in the future, it will be a deliberate decision and not by accident.</p>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#cve-2021-44548-apache-solr-information-disclosure-vulnerability-through-dataimporthandler" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong><br>
Moderate</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong><br>
All versions prior to 8.11.1. Affected platforms: Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in DataImportHandler of Apache Solr allows an attacker to provide a Windows UNC path resulting in an SMB network call being made from the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker has wider access to the network, this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes),</li>
<li>In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue affects all Apache Solr versions prior to 8.11.1. This issue only affects Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Upgrade to Solr 8.11.1, and/or ensure only trusted clients can make requests to Solr's DataImport handler.</p>
<p><strong>Credit:</strong><br>
Apache Solr would like to thank LaiHan of Nsfocus security team for reporting the issue</p>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#apache-solr-affected-by-apache-log4j-cve-2021-44228" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong>
Critical</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
7.4.0 to 7.7.3, 8.0.0 to 8.11.0</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Apache Solr releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE. For full impact and additional detail consult the Log4J security page.</p>
<p>Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender, see <a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126">https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126</a> for discussion.</p>
<p>Solr's Prometheus Exporter uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.</p>
<p>Solr is <em>not</em> vulnerable to the followup <strong>CVE-2021-45046</strong> and <strong>CVE-2021-45105</strong>.  A listing of these and other CVEs with some justifications are listed in Solr's wiki: <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SolrSecurity#SolrSecurity-SolrandVulnerabilityScanningTools">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SolrSecurity#SolrSecurity-SolrandVulnerabilityScanningTools</a></p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability for Solr servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to <code>Solr 8.11.1</code> or greater (when available), which will include an updated version (<code>&gt;= 2.16.0</code>) of the Log4J dependency.</li>
<li>If you are using Solr's official docker image, it has already been mitigated in all versions listed as supported on Docker Hub: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/solr">https://hub.docker.com/_/solr</a>.  You may need to re-pull the image.</li>
<li>Manually update the version of Log4J on your runtime classpath and restart your Solr application.</li>
<li>(Linux/MacOS) Edit your <code>solr.in.sh</code> file to include:
  <code>SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"</code></li>
<li>(Windows) Edit your <code>solr.in.cmd</code> file to include:
  <code>set SOLR_OPTS=%SOLR_OPTS% -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code></li>
<li>Follow any of the other mitgations listed at <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Log4J security page refers to setting <code>log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code> as a "discredited" mitigation.  In reality, it depends.
We've looked at the root cause and audited the code paths that lead to the vulnerability, and we feel confident in this mitigation being sufficient for Solr.

  <h2 id="cve-2021-27905-ssrf-vulnerability-with-the-replication-handler">12 April 2021, CVE-2021-27905: SSRF vulnerability with the Replication handler
    <a class="headerlink" href="#cve-2021-27905-ssrf-vulnerability-with-the-replication-handler" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong>
High</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication" under a Solr core) has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core.
To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the "shards" parameter.  Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to <code>Solr 8.8.2</code> or greater.</li>
<li>If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15217">SOLR-15217</a></li>
<li>Ensure that any access to the replication handler is purely internal to Solr.  Typically, it's only accessed externally for diagnostic/informational purposes.</li>

  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong>
High</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
When starting Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2, configured with the SaslZkACLProvider or VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider and no existing security.json znode, if the optional read-only user is configured then Solr would not treat that node as a sensitive path and would allow it to be readable.
Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually set appropriate ACLs on /security.json znode.</li>
<li>Upgrade to <code>Solr 8.8.2</code> or greater.</li>
<li>If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15249">SOLR-15249</a></li>
<li>Ensure that any access to zookeeper is only by trusted application.</li>

  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong>
High</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to <code>Solr 8.8.2</code> or greater.</li>
<li>If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15233">SOLR-15233</a></li>
<li>Use a different authentication plugin, such as the KerberosPlugin or HadoopAuthPlugin</li>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#apache-solr-becomes-an-apache-tlp" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p>The Apache Software Foundation's board today established Solr as a Top Level Project (TLP).
Solr has been a Lucene sub-project since its incubation in 2006, governed by the Lucene PMC,
and has since the 3.1 release also shared source code repository with Lucene.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-background">What's the background?</h3>
<p>The change was proposed by members of the Lucene PMC, and a vote in June 2020 decided
that Solr would be a separate TLP. Later, the Lucene PMC decided that the Solr project
would be bootstrapped with the same set of committers and PMC members as the "mother" Lucene project.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-affect-users">How does this affect users?</h3>
<p>The Solr software will not change at all as a result of this, but users will see these changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Solr gets a new website at <a href="http://solr.apache.org/">solr.apache.org</a></li>
<li>Solr gets a new download location in the mirrors</li>
<li>The email address of the users mailing-list will change, but subscribers will be moved automatically</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-does-this-affect-developers">How does this affect developers?</h3>
<p>Developers will have to do a number of things to adapt to the change</p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe to the new mailing lists. See <a href="/community.html#mailing-lists-chat">Mailing Lists &amp; Chat</a> for instructions</li>
<li>Start using <a href="/community.html#version-control">the new git location</a> by cloning or defining a new git remote</li>
<li>Realize that lucene will be a build dependency of Solr on the main branch (once the code migration is done)</li>
<li>Backported bug fixes for Solr 8.8 must be submitted to the Lucene git, for a joint bugfix release</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some things may be in flux during the migration work.</p>

High</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
6.6.0 to 6.6.6
7.0.0 to 7.7.3

<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Solr prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable UPLOAD command in ConfigSets API if not used by setting the system property: <code>configset.upload.enabled</code> to <code>false</code> (<a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/configsets-api.html">see docs</a>)</li>
<li>Use Authentication/Authorization and make sure unknown requests aren't allowed (<a href="https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/authentication-and-authorization-plugins.html">see docs</a>)</li>
<li>Upgrade to <code>Solr 8.6.3</code> or greater.</li>
<li>If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-14663">SOLR-14663</a></li>
<li>No Solr API, including the Admin UI, is designed to be exposed to non-trusted parties. Tune your firewall so that only trusted computers and people are allowed access</li>

<li>The possibility of restoring another SolrCore from a server on the network (or mounted remote file system) may lead to:<ul>
<li>Exposing search index data that the attacker should otherwise not have access to</li>
<li>Replacing the index data entirely by loading it from a remote file system that the attacker controls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launching SMB attacks which may result in:<ul>
<li>The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes),</li>
<li>In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>
Upgrade to Solr 8.6, and/or ensure only trusted clients can make requests of Solr's replication handler.</p>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#cve-2019-17558-apache-solr-rce-through-velocityresponsewriter" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>
5.0.0 to 8.3.1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The affected versions are vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution through the
VelocityResponseWriter.  A Velocity template can be provided through
Velocity templates in a configset <code>velocity/</code> directory or as a parameter.
A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious,
templates.  Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can
be enabled by setting <code>params.resource.loader.enabled</code> by defining a
response writer with that setting set to <code>true</code>.  Defining a response
writer requires configuration API access.</p>
<p>Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the
configset-provided template rendering when the configset is <code>trusted</code> (has
been uploaded by an authenticated user).</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic
communicates with Solr, especially to the configuration APIs.</p>

  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong>
High</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong><br>
Solr 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 for Linux</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 releases of Apache Solr contain an
insecure setting for the ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS configuration option
in the default solr.in.sh configuration file shipping with Solr.</p>
<p>Windows users are not affected.</p>
<p>If you use the default solr.in.sh file from the affected releases, then
JMX monitoring will be enabled and exposed on RMI_PORT (default=18983),
without any authentication. If this port is opened for inbound traffic
in your firewall, then anyone with network access to your Solr nodes
will be able to access JMX, which may in turn allow them to upload
malicious code for execution on the Solr server.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is already public [1] and mitigation steps were
announced on project mailing lists and news page [3] on August 14th,
without mentioning RCE at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Make sure your effective solr.in.sh file has ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS set
to 'false' on every Solr node and then restart Solr. Note that the
effective solr.in.sh file may reside in /etc/defaults/ or another
location depending on the install. You can then validate that the
'com.sun.management.jmxremote*' family of properties are not listed in
the "Java Properties" section of the Solr Admin UI, or configured in a
secure way.</p>
<p>There is no need to upgrade or update any code.</p>
<p>Remember to follow the Solr Documentation's advice to never expose Solr
nodes directly in a hostile network environment.</p>

  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3.0 to 1.4.1</li>
<li>3.1.0 to 3.6.2</li>
<li>4.0.0 to 4.10.4</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Solr versions prior to 5.0.0 are vulnerable to an XML resource

    <a class="headerlink" href="#cve-2019-0193-apache-solr-remote-code-execution-via-dataimporthandler" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5.0.0 to 5.5.5</li>
<li>6.0.0 to 6.6.5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from
databases and other sources, has a feature in which the whole DIH
configuration can come from a request's "dataConfig" parameter. The debug
mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging /
development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this
parameter is a security risk. Starting with version 8.2.0 of Solr, use of
this parameter requires setting the Java System property
<code>enable.dih.dataConfigParam</code> to true.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to 8.2.0 or later, which is secure by default.</li>
<li>or, edit solrconfig.xml to configure all DataImportHandler usages with an "invariants" section listing the "dataConfig" parameter set to am empty string.</li>
<li>Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic communicates with Solr, especially to the DIH request handler.  This is a best practice to all of Solr.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Solr now uses HTTP/2 for inter-node communication to attain greater efficiency.
Details:  Solr is switching from Apache HttpClient to Jetty Client for adding HTTP/2 support.
Most frequent inter-communication between nodes like indexing and query are now sent in HTTP/2.
HTTP/1.1 practically allows only one outstanding request per TCP connection this means that for sending multiple requests at the same time multiple TCP connections must be established.
This leads to waste of resources on both-sides and long GC-pause.
Solr 8 with HTTP/2 support overcomes that problem by allowing multiple requests can be sent in parallel using a same TCP connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nested documents (AKA child documents or block join) is significantly improved.
Most improvements come from storing and leveraging more information about the relationships in the index, like the named relationship between a child and its parent.
This information is used by the [child] doc transformer to return children in nested form instead of flat.
There is plenty more that can be done with this in the future.
Another key improvement is that nested documents can be deleted or replaced in a natural way without orphaning child documents; although care is still needed with delete-by-query.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a major release, Solr 8 removes many deprecated APIs, changes various parameter defaults and behavior. Some changes may require a re-index of your content.

  <p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5.0.0 to 5.5.5</li>
<li>6.0.0 to 6.6.5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
ConfigAPI allows to configure Solr's JMX server via an HTTP POST request.
By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage
of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the
Solr side.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to Apache Solr 7.0 or later.</li>
<li>Disable the ConfigAPI if not in use, by running Solr with the system property “disable.configEdit=true”</li>
<li>If upgrading or disabling the Config API are not viable options, apply patch in [1] and re-compile Solr.</li>
<li>Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic is allowed to ingress/egress your hosts running Solr.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bugfix for ClassCastException when URPs try to read a String field which returns a ByteArrayUTF8CHarSequence (a
   regression in release 7.7.0).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: Autoscaling based replica placement was broken out of the box. Solr 7.6 enabled autoscaling based replica
   placement by default but in the absence of default cluster policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the
   same shard on the same node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these reasons,
   this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy' assignment policy that was the default until
   Solr 7.5.</p>

  <p>CVE-2018-1308: XXE attack through Apache Solr's DIH's dataConfig request parameter</p>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Major</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solr 1.2 to 6.6.2</li>
<li>Solr 7.0.0 to 7.2.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The details of this vulnerability were reported to the Apache Security mailing list. </p>
<p>This vulnerability relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in the
<code>&amp;dataConfig=&lt;inlinexml&gt;</code> parameter of Solr's DataImportHandler. It can be
used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local
files from the Solr server or the internal network. See [1] for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.3 or Solr 7.3.0 releases both
of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps
are required. Those releases disable external entities in anonymous XML files
passed through this request parameter. </p>
<p>If users are unable to upgrade to Solr 6.6.3 or Solr 7.3.0 then they are
advised to disable data import handler in their solrconfig.xml file and
restart their Solr instances. Alternatively, if Solr instances are only used
locally without access to public internet, the vulnerability cannot be used
directly, so it may not be required to update, and instead reverse proxies or
Solr client applications should be guarded to not allow end users to inject
<code>dataConfig</code> request parameters. Please refer to [2] on how to correctly
secure Solr servers.</p>

  <p><strong>Severity:</strong> Important</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solr 5.0.0 to 5.5.4</li>
<li>Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.1</li>
<li>Solr 7.0.0 to 7.0.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Apache Solr uses Apache Tika for parsing binary file types such as
doc, xls, pdf etc. Apache Tika wraps the jmatio parser
(https://github.com/gradusnikov/jmatio) to handle MATLAB files. The
parser uses native deserialization on serialized Java objects embedded
in MATLAB files. A malicious user could inject arbitrary code into a
MATLAB file that would be executed when the object is deserialized.</p>
<p>This vulnerability was originally described at
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tika-user/201611.mbox/%3C2125912914.1308916.1478787314903%40mail.yahoo.com%3E</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 5.5.5 or Solr 6.6.2 or Solr 7.1.0
releases which have fixed this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Solr 5.5.5 upgrades the jmatio parser to v1.2 and disables the Java
deserialisation support to protect against this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Solr 6.6.2 and Solr 7.1.0 have upgraded the bundled Tika to v1.16.</p>
<p>Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required.</p>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#several-critical-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-apache-solr-xxe-rce" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Severity:</strong><br>
Critical</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Solr 5.5.0 to 5.5.4</li>
<li>Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.1</li>
<li>Solr 7.0.0 to 7.0.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
The details of this vulnerability were reported on public mailing
lists. See https://s.apache.org/FJDl</p>
<p>The first vulnerability relates to XML external entity expansion in
the XML Query Parser which is available, by default, for any query
request with parameters deftype=xmlparser. This can be exploited to
upload malicious data to the /upload request handler. It can also be
used as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local
files from the solr server.</p>
<p>The second vulnerability relates to remote code execution using the
RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.</p>
<p>At the time of the above report, this was a 0-day vulnerability with a
working exploit affecting the versions of Solr mentioned in the
previous section. However, mitigation steps were announced to protect
Solr users the same day. See
https://solr.apache.org/news.html#12-october-2017-please-secure-your-apache-solr-servers-since-a-zero-day-exploit-has-been-reported-on-a-public-mailing-list</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong><br>
Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.2 or Solr 7.1.0
releases both of which address the two vulnerabilities. Once upgrade is
complete, no other steps are required.</p>
<p>If users are unable to upgrade to Solr 6.6.2 or Solr 7.1.0 then they
are advised to restart their Solr instances with the system parameter
<code>-Ddisable.configEdit=true</code>. This will disallow any changes to be made
to your configurations via the Config API. This is a key factor in
this vulnerability, since it allows GET requests to add the
RunExecutableListener to your config. Users are also advised to re-map
the XML Query Parser to another parser to mitigate the XXE
vulnerability. For example, adding the following to the solrconfig.xml
file re-maps the xmlparser to the edismax parser:
<code>&lt;queryParser name="xmlparser" class="solr.ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin"/&gt;</code></p>

  <p>Please secure your Solr servers since a zero-day exploit has been
reported on a <a href="https://s.apache.org/FJDl">public mailing list</a>.
This has been assigned a public CVE (CVE-2017-12629) which we
will reference in future communication about resolution and mitigation
steps.</p>
<p>Here is what we're recommending and what we're doing now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Until fixes are available, all Solr users are advised to restart their
Solr instances with the system property <code>-Ddisable.configEdit=true</code>.
This will disallow any changes to be made to configurations via the
Config API. This is a key factor in this vulnerability, since it allows
GET requests to add the RunExecutableListener to the config. This is
sufficient to protect you from this type of attack, but means you cannot
use the edit capabilities of the Config API until the other fixes
described below are in place. Users are also advised to remap
the XML Query Parser to another parser to mitigate the XXE
vulnerability. For example, adding the following to the solrconfig.xml
file maps the <code>xmlparser</code> to the <code>edismax</code> parser:
<code>&lt;queryParser name="xmlparser" class="solr.ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin"/&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new release of Lucene/Solr was in the vote phase, but we have now
pulled it back to be able to address these issues in the upcoming 7.1
release. We will also determine mitigation steps for users on earlier
versions, which may include a 6.6.2 release for users still on 6.x.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RunExecutableListener will be removed in 7.1. It was previously
used by Solr for index replication but has been replaced and is no
longer needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The XML Parser will be fixed and the fixes will be included in the 7.1
release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 7.1 release was already slated to include a change to disable the
<code>stream.body</code> parameter by default, which will further help protect
systems.</p>

<h3 id="highlights-for-this-solr-release-include">Highlights for this Solr release include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replica Types - Solr 7 supports different replica types, which handle updates differently. In addition to pure NRT operation where all replicas build an index and keep a replication log, you can now also add so called PULL replicas, achieving the read-speed optimized benefits of a master/slave setup while at the same time keeping index redundancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-scaling. Solr can now allocate new replicas to nodes using a new auto scaling policy framework. This framework will in future releases enable Solr to move shards around based on load, disk etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indented JSON is now the default response format for all APIs, pass wt=xml and/or indent=off to use the previous unindented XML format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JSON Facet API now supports two-phase facet refinement to ensure accurate counts and statistics for facet buckets returned in distributed mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streaming Expressions adds a new statistical programming syntax for the statistical analysis of sql queries, random samples, time series and graph result sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analytics Component version 2.0, which now supports distributed collections, expressions over multivalued fields, a new JSON request language, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new v2 API, exposed at /api/ and also supported via SolrJ, is now the preferred API, but /solr/ continues to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new '_default' configset is used if no config is specified at collection creation. The data-driven functionality of this configset indexes strings as analyzed text while at the same time copying to a '*_str' field suitable for faceting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solr 7 is tested with and verified to support Java 9.</p>

  <p><strong>CVE-2017-9803: Security vulnerability in kerberos delegation token functionality</strong></p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Important</p>
<p><strong>Vendor</strong>:<br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected</strong>:<br>
Solr 6.2.0 to 6.6.0</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<p>Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application.
There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider),</p>
<p>Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is fixed from Solr 6.6.1 onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>:<br>
6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.1</p>

  <p><strong>CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication in Apache Solr</strong></p>
<p><strong>Severity</strong>: Important</p>
<p><strong>Vendor</strong>:<br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Solr 5.3 to 5.5.4</li>
<li>Solr 6.0 to 6.5.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication
when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted
node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a
malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that
the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have
enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin
or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which
does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or
"HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this
attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those
who use Kerberos are not affected.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.0 or higher</li>
<li>5.x users should obtain the latest source from git and apply this patch:

  </h2>
  <p><strong>CVE-2017-3163: Apache Solr ReplicationHandler path traversal attack</strong></p>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate</p>
<p><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>
The Apache Software Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Versions Affected:</strong><br>
Solr 1.4 to 6.4.0</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
When using the Index Replication feature, Solr nodes can pull index files from
a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However,
Solr did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special
request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server
process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules
and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users
would gain direct HTTP access.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6.x users should upgrade to 6.4.1</li>
<li>5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.4</li>
<li>4.x, 3.x and 1.4 users should upgrade to a supported version of Solr or setup proper firewalling, or disable the ReplicationHandler if not in use.</li>

  </h2>
  <p>The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.3.0.</p>
<p>Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics,
rich document parsing, geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well
as parallel SQL. Solr is enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable,
providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers
the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest
internet sites.</p>
<p>Solr 6.3.0 is available for immediate download at:
<a href="https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html">https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html</a></p>
<h3 id="highlights-of-this-solr-release-include">Highlights of this Solr release include:</h3>
<p>DocValues, streaming, /export, machine learning</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optimize, store and deploy AI models in Solr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to add custom streaming expressions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New streaming expressions such as "fetch", "executor", and "commit" added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parallel SQL accepts &lt;, &gt;, =, etc., symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support facet scoring with the scoreNodes expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieving docValues as stored values was sped up by using the proper leaf reader rather than ask for a global view.  In extreme cases, this leads to a 100x speedup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Faceting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>facet.method=enum can bypass exact counts calculation with facet.exists=true, it just returns 1 for terms which exists in result docset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add "overrequest" parameter to JSON Facet API to control amount of overrequest  on a distributed terms facet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Logging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now set Solr's log level through environment variable SOLR_LOG_LEVEL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GC logs are rotated by JVM to a max of 9 files, and backed up via bin/solr scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solr's logging verbosity at the INFO level has been greatly reduced by moving much logging to DEBUG level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solr-8983-console.log file now only logs STDOUT and STDERR output, not all log4j logs as before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solr's main log file, solr.log, is now written to SOLR_LOGS_DIR without changing log4j.properties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Start scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow 180 seconds for shutdown before killing solr (configurable, old limit 5s) (Unix only)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start scripts now exits with informative message if using wrong Java version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed "bin/solr.cmd zk upconfig" command which was broken on windows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now ask for DEBUG logging simply with '-v' option, and for WARN logging with '-q' option</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SolrCloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The DELETEREPLICA API can accept a 'count' parameter and remove "count" number of replicas from each shard if the shard name is not provided</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The config API shows expanded useParams for request handlers inline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to create/delete/list snapshots at collection level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The modify collection API now waits for the modified properties to show up in the cluster state before returning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many bug fixes related to SolrCloud recovery for data safety and faster recovery times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Security:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SolrJ now supports Kerberos delegation tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pooled SSL connections were not being re-used. This is now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix for the blockUnknown property which made inter-node communication impossible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_OPTS and SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_CONFIGURER in windows bin/solr.cmd script</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New parameter -u <user:pass> in bin/post to pass basicauth credentials</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Misc changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optimizations to lower memory allocations when indexing JSON as well as for replication between solr cloud nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new Excel workbook (.xlsx) response writer has been added. Use 'wt=xlsx' request parameter on a query request to enable.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved defaults for "Similarity" used in Solr, in order to provide better default experience for new users.</p>
</li>

  </h2>
  <p>As of January 23rd 2016, Lucene/Solr source code is hosted in Apache's GIT repository.
This means that the old SVN repository is now stale and should not be used.
For information on working with git, please consult
<a href="https://solr.apache.org/resources.html#solr-version-control">the Solr web site</a>
and the <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Git%20commit%20process">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/">GitHub mirror</a> remains at
the same location as before, but the contents have changed. We now have
one unified repo preserving the full history of both Lucene and Solr.
If you had a GitHub fork, you will find
that it has changed its "forked from" location, and any Pull Request will go to
that other fork instead of to the Lucene developers. The only known solution is to
delete your existing fork and re-fork from <a href="https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you had active code changes and Pull Requests against our old GitHub mirror,
please see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/HowToContribute#Working_with_GitHub">the wiki</a>
for some suggestions on how to proceed.</p>
<p>The PMC is happy to answer any question you may have regarding this change.</p>

<li>In built AuthorizationPlugin that provides fine grained control over implementing ACLs for various resources with permisssion rules which are stored in ZooKeeper.</li>
<li>The JSON Facet API can now change the domain for facet commands, essentially doing a block join and moving from parents to children, or children to parents before calculating the facet data.</li>
<li>Major improvements in performance of the new Facet Module / JSON Facet API.</li>
<li>Query and Range Facets under Pivot Facets. Just like the JSON Facet API, pivot facets can how nest other facet types such as range and query facets.</li>
<li>More Like This Query Parser options. The MoreLikeThis QParser now supports all options provided by the MLT Handler. The query parser is much more versatile than the handler as it works in cloud mode as well as anywhere a normal query can be specified.</li>

  <p>Apache Solr versions 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0 bundle Apache POI 3.10-beta2 with its binary release tarball.
This version (and all previous ones) of Apache POI are vulnerable to the following issues:</p>
<h3 id="cve-2014-3529-xml-external-entity-xxe-problem-in-apache-pois-openxml-parser">CVE-2014-3529: XML External Entity (XXE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser</h3>
<p><em>Information disclosure:</em> Apache POI uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...).
Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allows remote attackers to bypass
security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction
with an entity reference.</p>

(DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks ("XML bombs"),
which allows remote hackers to consume large amounts of CPU resources.</p>
<p><strong>The Apache POI PMC released a bugfix version (3.10.1) today.</strong></p>
<p>Solr users are affected by these issues, if they enable the "Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)"
contrib module from the folder "contrib/extraction" of the release tarball.</p>
<p>Users of Apache Solr are strongly advised to keep the module disabled if they don't use it.
Alternatively, users of Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, or 4.9.0 can update the affected libraries by
replacing the vulnerable JAR files in the distribution folder. Users of previous versions have
to update their Solr release first, patching older versions is impossible.</p>

    <a class="headerlink" href="#apache-solr-48-will-require-java-7" title="Permanent link">¶</a>
  </h2>
  <p>The Apache Solr committers decided with a large majority on the vote to require <strong>Java 7</strong> for the next minor release of Apache Solr (version 4.8)!</p>
<p>The next release will also contain some improvements for Java 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Better file handling (especially on Windows) in the directory implementations. Files can now be deleted on windows, although the index is still open - like it was always possible on Unix environments (delete on last close semantics).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed improvements in sorting comparators: Sorting now uses Java 7's own comparators for integer and long sorts, which are highly optimized by the Hotspot VM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to stay up-to-date with Lucene and Solr, you should upgrade your infrastructure to Java 7.
Please be aware that you must use at least use Java 7u1.
The recommended version at the moment is Java 7u25. Later versions like 7u40, 7u45,... have a bug causing index corrumption.
Ideally use the Java 7u60 prerelease, which has fixed this bug. Once 7u60 is out, this will be the recommended version.
In addition, there is no more Oracle/BEA JRockit available for Java 7, use the official Oracle Java 7.
JRockit was never working correctly with Lucene/Solr (causing index corrumption), so this should not be an issue.
Please also review our list of JVM bugs: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs">http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs</a></p>
<p><em>EDIT (as of 15 April 2014):</em> The recently released Java 7u55 fixes the above bug causing index corrumption.
This version is now the recommended version for running Apache Solr.</p>
