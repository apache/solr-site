<p><a href="https://testmysearch.com/books/inside-solr.html"><img alt="Inside Apache Solr and Lucene (cover)" class="float-right" src="/images/solr/book_inside_solr_lucene.png"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raufaliev/">Rauf Aliev</a> is proud to announce his book, "<a href="https://testmysearch.com/books/inside-solr.html">Inside Apache Solr and Lucene: Algorithms and Engineering Deep Dive</a>". This book dives deep into the core of Apache Solr and Lucene, offering answers from a system engineer's perspective. It explores the architectural decisions, data structures, and algorithms that enable these world-class search platforms to deliver exceptional performance and scalability, providing a blueprint for designing high-performance systems.</p>
<p>What sets this book apart is its focus on the 'why' behind the 'how'. It follows an engineering-first approach, often starting with a core problem (like high memory usage or slow queries), examining naive solutions, and then detailing the specific data structures and underlying algorithms Solr and Lucene's developers implemented. This deep dive covers not just the inverted index, but the inner workings of Finite-State Transducers (FSTs), Pulsing Codecs, HNSW for vector search, Roaring Bitmaps, Delta Encoding, Skip Lists, PackedInts, LZ4 compression, Memory-Mapped I/O, and SIMD vectorization.</p>
<p>The insights in this book extend beyond the Solr and Lucene ecosystem. By using these platforms as a masterclass in pragmatic engineering, it offers valuable lessons for building any complex, data-intensive application. This book breaks down these complex systems, distilling years of development and thousands of lines of code into core principles and patterns. It's an opportunity to learn from the architectural choices of high-load systems, offering useful information for architects and engineers. Paperback and e-book versions are available. A preview of the first part of the book is also available for download.</p>

You can find links to buy it at Packt’s site &amp; Amazon from our book’s official website: <a href="http://www.solrenterprisesearchserver.com">solrenterprisesearchserver.com</a>.  You'll find a useful search parameter quick-reference sheet (the appendix) online there too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.solrenterprisesearchserver.com"><img alt="Apache Solr Enterprise Search Server, Third Edition (cover)" class="float-right" src="/images/solr/book_asess_3ed.jpg"></a>
<strong>Apache Solr Enterprise Search Server, Third Edition</strong> is a comprehensive resource to almost everything Solr has to offer. It serves the reader right from initiation to development to deployment. It also comes with complete running examples to demonstrate its use and show how to integrate Solr with other languages and frameworks — even Hadoop.</p>
<p>By using a large set of metadata, including artists, releases, and tracks, courtesy of the MusicBrainz.org project, you will have a testing ground for Solr and will learn how to import this data in various ways. You will then learn how to search this data in different ways, including Solr's rich query syntax and boosting match scores based on record data. Finally, we'll cover various deployment considerations to include indexing strategies and performance-oriented configuration that will enable you to scale Solr to meet the needs of a high-volume site.</p>
<p>Solr 4 was Solr's biggest release ever. We updated the previous edition to cover Solr 4, and some of Solr 5 -- particularly the part of Solr 5 that needs to be covered most, the bin/solr script. Chapter 9, Integrating Solr, now covers Hadoop integration, and better covers SolrJ. Chapter 3, Text Analysis, introduces various approaches for implementing Multilingual Search in your applications. And we think you'll appreciate the enhanced coverage of the topic of query auto-suggesters (AKA query completion) in Chapter 8, Search Components -- a feature that is important to most search applications. This edition has two additional authors, Kranti &amp; Matt, who add their perspectives based on their experience working with Solr for a long time.</p>

In this book, we will look under the hood of a large number of topics and discuss answers to pertinent questions such as why denormalize data, how to import classical databases' data inside Apache Solr, how to serve Solr through five different web servers, how to optimize them to serve Solr even faster. An important and major topic covered in this book is Solr's querying mechanism, which will prove to be a strong ally in our journey through this book. We then look at boosting performance and deploying Solr using several servlet servers. Finally, we cover how to communicate with Solr using different programming languages, before deploying it in a cloud-based environment.</p>
<p><strong>Mastering Apache Solr</strong> is written lucidly and has a clear simple approach. From the first page to the last, the book remains practical and focuses on the most important topics used in the world of Apache Solr without neglecting important theoretical fundamentals that help you build a strong foundation.</p>
