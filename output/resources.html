You can find links to buy it at Packt’s site &amp; Amazon from our book’s official website: <a href="http://www.solrenterprisesearchserver.com">solrenterprisesearchserver.com</a>.  You'll find a useful search parameter quick-reference sheet (the appendix) online there too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.solrenterprisesearchserver.com"><img alt="Apache Solr Enterprise Search Server, Third Edition (cover)" class="float-right" src="/images/solr/book_asess_3ed.jpg"></a>
<strong>Apache Solr Enterprise Search Server, Third Edition</strong> is a comprehensive resource to almost everything Solr has to offer. It serves the reader right from initiation to development to deployment. It also comes with complete running examples to demonstrate its use and show how to integrate Solr with other languages and frameworks — even Hadoop.</p>
<p>By using a large set of metadata, including artists, releases, and tracks, courtesy of the MusicBrainz.org project, you will have a testing ground for Solr and will learn how to import this data in various ways. You will then learn how to search this data in different ways, including Solr's rich query syntax and boosting match scores based on record data. Finally, we'll cover various deployment considerations to include indexing strategies and performance-oriented configuration that will enable you to scale Solr to meet the needs of a high-volume site.</p>
<p>Solr 4 was Solr's biggest release ever. We updated the previous edition to cover Solr 4, and some of Solr 5 -- particularly the part of Solr 5 that needs to be covered most, the bin/solr script. Chapter 9, Integrating Solr, now covers Hadoop integration, and better covers SolrJ. Chapter 3, Text Analysis, introduces various approaches for implementing Multilingual Search in your applications. And we think you'll appreciate the enhanced coverage of the topic of query auto-suggesters (AKA query completion) in Chapter 8, Search Components -- a feature that is important to most search applications. This edition has two additional authors, Kranti &amp; Matt, who add their perspectives based on their experience working with Solr for a long time.</p>
