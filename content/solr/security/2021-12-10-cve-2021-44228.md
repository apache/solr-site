Title: Apache Solr affected by Apache Log4J CVE-2021-44228
category: solr/security
cve: CVE-2021-44228

**Severity:**
Critical

**Versions Affected:**
7.4.0 to 7.7.3, 8.0.0 to 8.11.0

**Description:**
Apache Solr releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE. For full impact and additional detail consult the Log4J security page.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use log4j 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender, see https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126 for discussion.

The Prometheus Exporter Contrib is similarly separately affected.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability for Solr servers:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.11.1` or greater (when available), which will include an updated version of the log4j2 dependency.
* Manually update the version of log4j2 on your runtime classpath and restart your Solr application.
* (Linux/MacOS) Edit your `solr.in.sh` file to include:
  `SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"`
* (Windows) Edit your `solr.in.cmd` file to include:
  `set SOLR_OPTS=%SOLR_OPTS% -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
* Follow any of the other mitgations listed at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>

The vulnerability in the Prometheus Exporter Contrib can be mitigated by any of the following:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.11.1` or greater (when available), which will include an updated version of the log4j2 dependency.
* Manually update the version of log4j2 on your runtime classpath and restart your Solr application.
* Edit your `solr-exporter` script to include:
  `JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"`
* Follow any of the other mitgations listed at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>
