Title: Apache Solr affected by Apache Log4J CVE-2021-44228
category: solr/security
cve: CVE-2021-44228

**Severity:**
Critical

**Versions Affected:**
7.4.0 to 7.7.3, 8.0.0 to 8.11.0

**Description:**
Apache Solr releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE. For full impact and additional detail consult the Log4J security page.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender, see <https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126> for discussion.

Solr's Prometheus Exporter uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability for Solr servers:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.11.1` or greater (when available), which will include an updated version of the Log4J dependency.
* If you are using Solr's official docker image, no matter the version, it has already been mitigated.  You may need to re-pull the image.
* Manually update the version of Log4J on your runtime classpath and restart your Solr application.
* (Linux/MacOS) Edit your `solr.in.sh` file to include:
  `SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"`
* (Windows) Edit your `solr.in.cmd` file to include:
  `set SOLR_OPTS=%SOLR_OPTS% -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
* Follow any of the other mitgations listed at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>
