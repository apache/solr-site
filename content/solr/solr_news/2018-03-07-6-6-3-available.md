Title: Apache Solr™ 6.6.3 available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.6.3.

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features
of many of the world's largest internet sites.

This release contains three bugfixes:

 * Disallow reference to external resources in DataImportHandler's dataConfig request parameter
 * Allow collections created with legacyCloud=true to be opened if legacyCloud=false
 * LeaderInitiatedRecoveryThread now retries on UnknownHostException
