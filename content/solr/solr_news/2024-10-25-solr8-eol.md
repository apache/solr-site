Title: Solr 8 reaches End-Of-Life
category: solr/news
save_as:

After the release of Solr 8.11.4, the Apache Solr community will no longer provide support for Solr 8.11.
With Lucene 10 having been released, and therefore Lucene 8.11 reaching EOL, the Apache Lucene and Solr community are no longer able to provide new releases for Solr 8.

Users are strongly recommended to upgrade to Solr 9, and prepare for the soon-to-be-released Solr 10.
