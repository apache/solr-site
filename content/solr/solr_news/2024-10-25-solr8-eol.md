Title: Solr 8 reaches End-Of-Life
category: solr/news
save_as:

With Lucene 10 having been released, and therefore Lucene 8 reaching EOL, the Apache Lucene and Solr PMCs are no longer able to provide new releases for Solr 8.
Solr 8.11.4 will be the last release of Solr 8.

Users are strongly recommended to upgrade to Solr 9, and prepare for the soon-to-be-released Solr 10.
