Title: Apache Solr™ 8.3.0 available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 8.3.0.

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 8.3.0 is available for immediate download at:

### Solr 8.3.0 Release Highlights:

  * Two dimensional routed aliases are now available for organizing collections based on the data values of two fields
  * SPLITSHARD implements a new splitByPrefix option that takes into account the actual document distribution when using compositeIds
  * QueryElevationComponent can have query rules configured with match="subset" wherein the words need only match a subset of the query's words and in any order
  * Command line option to export documents to a file
  * Support deterministic replica routing preferences for better cache usage
  * Ability to query aliases in Solr Admin UI
  * JWTAuthPlugin supports multiple JWKS endpoints and multiple IdP issuers
  * JSON faceting now supports arbitrary ranges for range facets
  * Support integral plots, cosine distance and string truncation with math expressions (Joel Bernstein)
  * New cat() stream source to create tuples from lines in local files
  * Add upper, lower, trim and split Stream Evaluators
  * Add CsvStream, TsvStream Streaming Expressions and supporting Stream Evaluators
  * Add CaffeineCache, an efficient implementation of SolrCache
  * Live SPLITSHARD can lose updates due to cluster state change between checking if the current shard is active and later checking if there are any sub-shard leaders to forward the update to
  * Fix for SPLITSHARD (async) with failures in underlying sub-operations can result in data loss
  * Allow dynamic resizing of SolrCache-s
  * Allow optional redaction of data saved by 'bin/solr autoscaling -save'
  * Optimized large managed schema modifications (internal O(n^2) problem)
  * Max idle time support for SolrCache implementations
  * Add Prometheus Exporter GC and Heap options
  * SSL: Adding Enabling/Disabling client's hostname verification config
  * Introducing SolrClient.ping(collection) in SolrJ
  * Fix for CDCR bootstrap not replicating index to the replicas of target cluster
  * Fixed a race condition when initializing metrics for new security plugins on security.json change
  * Fixed JWTAuthPlugin to update metrics prior to continuing w/other filters or returning error
  * Fixed distributed grouping when multiple 'fl' params are specified
  * JMX MBeans are not exposed because of race condition between creating platform mbean server and registering mbeans
  * Fix for class-cast issues during atomic-update 'removeregex' operations
  * Fix for multi-node race condition to create/remove nodeLost markers
  * Fix for too many cascading calls to remote servers, which can bring down nodes
  * Fix for MOVEREPLICA ignoring replica type and always adding 'nrt' replicas
  * Fix: DistributedZkUpdateProcessor should propagate URP.finish() lifecycle (regression since 8.1)
