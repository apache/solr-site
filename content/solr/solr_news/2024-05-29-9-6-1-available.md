Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

* Replicas are ensured to be marked as down when a Solr node is started
* 'Illegal character in query' exception in the new HttpJdkSolrClient has been fixed
* Performance regression for aliases in SolrJ has been fixed via partially reverting a recent change
* Fixed debugging of Rerank Queries when reRankScale is used
