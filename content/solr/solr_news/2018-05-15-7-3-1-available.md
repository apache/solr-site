Title: Apache Solr™ 7.3.1 available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 7.3.1

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation
features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

This release includes 9 bug fixes since the 7.3.0 release. Some of the major fixes are:

* Upgrade commons-fileupload dependency to 1.3.3 to address CVE-2016-1000031
* Deleting replicas sometimes fails and causes the replicas to exist in the down state
* A successful restore collection should mark the shard state as active and not buffering
* Do not allow to use absolute URIs for including other files in solrconfig.xml and schema parsing

Furthermore, this release includes Apache Lucene 7.3.1 which includes 1 bug
fix since the 7.3.0 release.
