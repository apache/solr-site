Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

### Solr 8.11.0 Release Highlights:

#### Security

MultiAuthPlugin (for authentication) and MultiAuthRuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (for authorization) classes to support multiple authentication schemes, such as Bearer and Basic. This allows the Admin UI to use OIDC (JWTAuthPlugin) to authenticate users while still supporting Basic authentication for command-line tools and the Prometheus exporter.
