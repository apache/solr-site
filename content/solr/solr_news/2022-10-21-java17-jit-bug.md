Title: Java 17 bug affecting Solr
category: solr/news
save_as:

Several users running Solr in production on OpenJDK 17 have experienced JVM crashes due to a known bug in the JDK. Read more about the bug in [SOLR-16463](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16463).

Known mitigations are to either downgrade to JDK 11 or to start Solr with a Java startup flag that avoids the failure condition. Here is how to manually apply the flag:

Edit your `solr.in.sh` or `solr.in.cmd` file to set the `SOLR_OPTS` environment variable as follows:

*Linux:* 
```bash
SOLR_OPTS=-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put
```

*Windows:*
```bash
SET SOLR_OPTS=-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put
```

Alternatively, you can inject the same flag with the `-a` argument, e.g:
```bash
bin/solr -a "-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put"
```

If you run Solr 9 with the official Docker image, we have already pushed an updated Docker image to Docker Hub that will inject the flag for you.
Just pull the image again to get it.
The Docker image uses the `-a` option to set this java flag when running Solr, so if you are using the 
`-a` option you will need to provide the JVM flag mentioned above in addition to the other flags you are setting.
