### Solr 9.10.1 Release Highlights:

Solr 9.10.1 contains a number of bugfixes and quality-of-life improvements, including:

* Reversing a performance regression impacting "no rows" Solr queries.
* Fixing an error previously triggered when sorting on spatial field types.
* Preventing a deadlock that caused "hanging" / "orphaning" for distributed request threads when using ParallelHttpShardHandler

Solr 9.10.1 also includes fixes for two recently published security issues, CVE-2026-22444 and CVE-2026-22022.  Administrators should either upgrade their deployments to Solr 9.10.1 to include these fixes and/or ensure that adequate remediation is in place as described in the CVE descriptions.
