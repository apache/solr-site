### Solr Operator v0.6.0 Release Highlights:

* Users are now able to specify resource constraints for all init-containers.
* The default Solr image version used in newly created solrcloud's has been updated from 8.9 to 8.11
* solrcloud now has a 'solrZkOpts' field, allowing users to specify any system properties needed to connect to their ZooKeeper cluster.
* Users running in GKE can now omit the 'gcsCredentialSecret' field from the GCS backup repositories, and fallback on "Workload Identity" and other "credential-less" authentication mechanisms offered by Google Cloud.
