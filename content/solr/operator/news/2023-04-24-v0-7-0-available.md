### Solr Operator v0.7.0 Release Highlights:

* The minimum Kubernetes version supported is now v1.21.
* The required Zookeeper Operator version has been upgraded to v0.2.15.
* Clusterwide PodDisruptionBudgets are now created for SolrClouds by default.
* During a rolling restart/update, SolrCloud pods are now taken out of the common service endpoint before they are decommissioned. This should improve request reliability during rolling restarts.
* Many missing Provided Zookeeper options have been added.
* Using volume backupRepositories now initialize faster on pod creation and work with custom user/fsGroup.
* Default SolrCloud and SolrPrometheusExporter Pod probes have been improved.
* Bug fixed in non-recurring backups.
