### Solr Operator v0.9.0 Release Highlights:

* **Security Configuration**: 0.9.0 gives users greater control over their security configuration than ever before, including new settings to specify the "securityContext" used by each Solr container and an "imagePullSecret" to use when pulling the operator image.
* **Resource Cleanup**: The operator now safely cleans up ingresses and node-services as necessary when externalAddressability settings are modified.
