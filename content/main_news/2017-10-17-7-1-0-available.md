The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 7.1.0 and Apache Solr 7.1.0.

Lucene can be downloaded from <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/7.1.0>
and Solr can be downloaded from <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/7.1.0>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

 * New Geo3D shapes for non-spherical planet models

 * Serialization and deserialization support for Geo3D

 * A new CoveringQuery, whose required number of matching clauses can be defined per document

 * New BengaliAnalyzer for Bengali language

 * A point based range field called LatLonBoundingBox

 * FloatPointNearestNeighbor, an N-dimensional FloatPoint K-nearest-neighbor search implementation

 * Faster default taxonomy cache

 * Support for computing facet counts for individual numeric values via LongValueFacetCounts

 * Faster geo-distance queries in case of dense single-valued fields when most documents match

 * Better heuristics in IndexOrDocValuesQuery

 * Optimized builds for OrdinalMap (used by SortedSetDocValuesFacetCounts and others)

### Highlights for this Solr release include:

 * Critical Security Update: Fix for CVE-2017-12629 which is a working 0-day exploit reported on the [public mailing list](https://s.apache.org/FJDl).

 * Auto-scaling: Solr can now move replicas automatically when a new node is added or an existing node is removed using the auto scaling policy framework introduced in 7.0

 * Auto-scaling: The 'autoAddReplicas' feature which was limited to shared file systems is now available for all file systems. It has been ported to use the new autoscaling framework internally.

 * Auto-scaling: New set-trigger, remove-trigger, set-listener, remove-listener, suspend-trigger, resume-trigger APIs

 * Auto-scaling: New /autoscaling/history API to show past autoscaling actions and cluster events

 * New JSON based Query DSL for Solr that extends JSON Request API to also support all query parsers and their nested parameters

 * JSON Facet API: min/max aggregations are now supported on single-valued date fields

 * Lucene's Geo3D (surface of sphere & ellipsoid) is now supported on spatial RPT fields by setting spatialContextFactory="Geo3D". Furthermore, this is the first time Solr has out of the box support for polygons

 * Expanded support for statistical stream evaluators such as various distributions, rank correlations, distances and more.

 * Multiple other optimizations and bug fixes
