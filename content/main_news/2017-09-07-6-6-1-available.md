Title: Apache Lucene 6.6.1 and Apache Solr 6.6.1 Available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.6.1 and Apache Solr 6.6.1.

Lucene can be downloaded from <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.6.1>
and Solr can be downloaded from <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/6.6.1>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

  * Documents with multiple points that should match might not match on a memory index

  * A query which has only one synonym with AND as the default operator would wrongly translate as an AND between the query term and the synonym

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

  * Standalone Solr loads UNLOADed core on request

  * ParallelStream should set the StreamContext when constructing SolrStreams

  * CloudSolrStream.toExpression incorrectly handles fq clauses

  * CoreContainer.load needs to send lazily loaded core descriptors to the proper list rather than send them all to the transient lists

  * Creating a core should write a core.properties file first and clean up on failure

  * Clean up a few details left over from pluggable transient core and untangling

  * Provide a way to know when Core Discovery is finished and when all async cores are done loading

  * CDCR bootstrapping can get into an infinite loop when a core is reloaded

  * SolrJmxReporter is broken on core reload. This resulted in some or most metrics not being reported via JMX after core reloads, depending on timing

  * Creating a core.properties fails if the parent of core.properties is a symlinked directory

  * StreamHandler should allow connections to be closed early

  * Certain admin UI pages would not load up correctly with kerberos enabled

  * Fix DOWNNODE -> queue-work znode explosion in ZooKeeper

  * Upgrade to Hadoop 2.7.4 to fix incompatibility with Java 9

  * Fix bin/solr.cmd so it can run properly on Java 9
