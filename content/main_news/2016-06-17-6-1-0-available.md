The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 6.1.0 and Apache Solr 6.1.0.

Lucene can be downloaded from <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/java/6.1.0>
and Solr can be downloaded from <http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/6.1.0>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

  * Numerous improvements to LatLonPoint, for indexing a latitude/longitude point and searching by polygon, distance or box, or finding nearest neighbors

  * Geo3D now has simple APIs for creating common shape queries, matching LatLonPoint

  * Faster indexing and searching of points.

  * Faster geo-spatial indexing and searching for LatLonPoint, Geo3D and GeoPoint (see http://home.apache.org/~mikemccand/geobench.html )

  * HardlinkCopyDirectoryWrapper optimizes file copies using hard links

  * In case of contention, the query cache now prefers returning an uncached Scorer rather than waiting on a lock.

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

 * Added graph traversal support, and new "sort" and "random" streaming expressions. It's also now possible to create streaming expressions with the Solr Admin UI.

 * Fixed the ENUM faceting method to not be unnecessarily rewritten to FCS, which was causing slowdowns.

 * Reduced garbage creation when creating cache entries.

 * New [subquery] document transformer to obtatin related documents per result doc.

 * EmbeddedSolrServer allocates heap much wisely even with plain document list without callbacks.

 * New GeoJSON response writer for encoding geographic data in query responses.
