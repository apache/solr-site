## Support ##

The Solr Community provides user support for free through the [users mailing list](#mailing-lists-irc) and other channels mentioned
here. There are also a number of external companies and professionals ready to help, see the user-maintained list at
[cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Support).

## Mailing Lists & Chat ##

We use [mailing lists](https://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html) for all official project communications.
To subscribe or unsubscribe you need to send an email to special addresses (e.g. users-subscribe@solr.apache.org to subscribe to the users list).
This email must be sent from **the email address you want to subscribe as or unsubscribe from**. You will then need to
confirm by replying to an automated e-mail from the list software. Clicking the `SUBSCRIBE` or `UNSUBSCRIBE` buttons below
will open your e-mail software with a pre-filled email that is ready to send.  

#### Mailing list etiquette

Written communication is hard and prone to misunderstandings. We recommend reading [ComDev's etiquette page](https://community.apache.org/contributors/etiquette) for some practical tips on how to improve.

#### Solr User List: users@solr.apache.org ####

This list is for users of Solr to ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss issues.  We strongly encourage
users to send usage and configuration questions and problems to this mailing list.  Before filing an issue in
the JIRA issue tracker, make sure it's a real bug and that it hasn't been already discovered by discussing it here.

<a class="btn" href="mailto:users-subscribe@solr.apache.org?subject=subscribe">&#x1F4E7;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subscribe</a>
<a class="btn" href="mailto:users-unsubscribe@solr.apache.org?subject=unsubscribe">&#x1F4E7;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsubscribe</a>

<a class="btn" href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@solr.apache.org">&#x1F517;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archives</a>

> **NOTE:** This list was named [solr-user@lucene.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?solr-user@lucene.apache.org) while Solr was a Lucene subproject. The list was migrated to Solr in March 2021, including subscriptions and archive.

#### Developer List: dev@solr.apache.org ####

This is the list where participating developers of the Solr project meet and discuss
issues concerning Solr internals, code changes/additions, etc. **Please do not send mail to this list with usage questions or configuration questions and problems, that is what the users mailing list is for.**

<a class="btn" href="mailto:dev-subscribe@solr.apache.org?subject=subscribe">&#x1F4E7;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subscribe</a>
<a class="btn" href="mailto:dev-unsubscribe@solr.apache.org?subject=unsubscribe">&#x1F4E7;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsubscribe</a>

Also see developer discussion archives at [dev@lucene.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@lucene.apache.org) from when Solr was a Lucene subproject.

#### IRC  ####

There are two primary IRC channels dedicated to Solr at libera.chat.

• #solr -- Channel for Solr user questions

• #solr-dev -- Hangout for discussion of Solr development

The IRC channel can be used for online discussion about Solr related stuff,
but developers should be careful to transfer all the official decisions or useful discussions to the issue
tracking system.  Note that the users mailing list will reach a lot more people than the IRC channel,
but if it's the right time of day, the IRC channel can offer a more interactive experience with faster turnaround.

[This wiki page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/IRCChannels) has links to a web-based IRC client, and a
wealth of information about how to get the most out of the IRC channels.

#### Slack ####

* The project's Slack channel is `#solr-dev` in the `the-asf` organization. This is primarily for developer
  discussions and not meant as support channels. Link: <https://the-asf.slack.com/messages/CE70MDPMF>

* There are unofficial slack organizations for Solr support
    * A community maintained/unofficial Slack organization that relays messages bi-directionally to/from the official IRC channels. Link: <https://s.apache.org/solr-slack>
    * For relevance related discussions (Solr and other search engines), there's Relevance Slack: <https://relevancy.slack.com>.    Sign up via <https://opensourceconnections.com/slack>

## Issue tracker ##

Solr uses the ASF JIRA instance.

You can browse, search, and create issues [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR).
Patches welcome!  This is not the correct place to start when you need support.  Problems should be
discussed on the mailing list and/or via IRC before creating an issue.

## How To Contribute ##

Looking to contribute to Solr?  Read the [instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/HowToContribute) on
contributing and then submit a patch!

## Code of Conduct ##

For a large and diverse community like ours to be friendly, welcoming and respectful, we recognize the need for some guidelines. The project follows [Apache's Code of Conduct statement](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct). Please take some time to read and understand it.

If you feel there has been a violation of this code, please point out your concerns publicly in a friendly and matter of fact manner. Nonverbal communication is prone to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. Everyone has bad days and sometimes says things they regret later. Someone else's communication style may clash with yours, but the difference can be amicably resolved. After pointing out your concerns please be generous upon receiving an apology.

Should there be repeated instances of code of conduct violations, or if there is an obvious and severe violation, the Solr PMC may become involved.

### The Apache Way

As an Apache project we strive to follow [The Apache Way](http://theapacheway.com/). If you are new to the community or to open source in general, you may benefit from understanding our core values as a community, and why we operate the way we do.

## Version Control ##

The Solr source code resides in the Apache [GIT](http://git.apache.org) repository. Various GIT clients
can be obtained from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). There are also GIT integrations for various
IDEs. For Eclipse, look at [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/). IntelliJ has git support bundled, if you
have installed the command line version.

#### Web Access (read-only) ####

The source code can be browsed at <https://github.com/apache/solr> and also <https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=solr.git>.
No GIT client software is required.

#### Cloning the repository ####

To work on the code locally, you may clone the git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/apache/solr.git

Then use GitHub's [fork feature](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
to obtain a personal fork from which you can later contribute your changes through a
[Pull Request](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-WorkingwithGitHub)
or a [patch in Jira](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-Generatingapatch).

You may alternatively choose to clone apache's git mirror at `https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/solr.git`.
