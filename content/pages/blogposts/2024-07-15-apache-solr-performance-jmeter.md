# Benchmark Apache Solr Performance With Apache JMeter

If you are familiar with Apache Solr and have no idea how to create a Solr performance test, you are in the right place.
This blog post illustrates how to create Solr benchmarks using the JMeter tool. We will stress test Apache Solr query time capabilities by submitting several queries, where the query term (of a specific field) changes each time, to simulate real users sending multiple requests to the server.
