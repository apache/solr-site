# Join Us at Community Over Code North America 2024!

We are happy to announce that **Community Over Code North America 2024** is happening from **October 7-10, 2024**, at the **Grand Hyatt Denver**, in the heart of Denver, Colorado! This is the premier event where developers, technologists, and thought leaders from across Apache projects come together to collaborate and innovate.

## What to Expect

**Community Over Code** will be a four-day event filled with deep-dive sessions, inspiring keynotes, and hands-on workshops, featuring a wide range of topics, including:

- **Search** (including Apache Solr)

The event is an excellent opportunity for Solr enthusiasts to connect with the broader Apache community and learn the latest trends and innovations across various Apache projects.

## Birds of a Feather (BoF) Sessions

Each evening will feature **Birds of a Feather (BoF)** sessions — an informal, free-form opportunity for attendees to gather around topics they are passionate about. This is a great time to discuss specific projects, network with like-minded developers, and plan for the future. The Solr community will have its own BoF sessions, so be sure to join us to discuss what's next for Solr!
