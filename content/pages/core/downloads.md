Official releases are usually created when the [developers]({filename}/pages/whoweare.md)
feel there are sufficient changes, improvements and bug fixes to warrant a release.
Due to the voluntary nature of Lucene, no releases are scheduled in advance.
System Requirements are detailed [here]({filename}/pages/core/systemreqs.md).
