## How to report a security issue
If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in Solr, you may first want to consult the [list of known false positives](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SolrSecurity#SolrSecurity-SolrandVulnerabilityScanningTools) to make sure you are reporting a real vulnerability.
Then please disclose responsibly by following [these ASF guidelines](https://www.apache.org/security/) for reporting.

The Solr PMC will not accept the output of a vulnerability scan as a security report.
Please do not email the security list with issues on Solr dependencies or outputs from vulnerability scanning tools.

You may file your request by email to <mailto:security@solr.apache.org>.
