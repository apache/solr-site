Official releases are usually created when the [developers]({filename}/pages/whoweare.md)
feel there are sufficient changes, improvements and bug fixes to warrant a release.
Due to the voluntary nature of Solr Operator development, no releases are scheduled in advance.

The suggested method of installing the Solr Operator in your Kubernetes cluster is via the [provided Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/apache-solr/solr-operator).
Source releases are provided for the operator, however binaries are only provided via the official [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/solr-operator).
