    "detail": "These CVEs, and most of the known jackson-databind CVEs since 2017, are all related to problematic 'gadgets' that could be exploited during deserialization of untrusted data. The Jackson developers described 4 conditions that must be met in order for a problematic gadget to be exploited. See https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062. Solr's use of jackson-databind does not meet 1 of the 4 conditions described which makes these CVEs unexploitable. The specific condition that Solr does not meet is the 3rd one: 'Enable polymorphic type handling' Solr does not include any polymorphic type handling, and Solr does not configure jackson-databind de/serialization to expect or include class names in serialized JSON. Two CVEs, 2019-14540 & 2019-16335, are related to HikariConfig and HikariDataSource classes, neither of which are used in Solr's code base."
