  "analysis": {
    "state": "not_affected",
    "detail": "Solr uses commons-text directly (StringEscapeUtils.escapeEcmaScript) in LoadAdminUiServlet that is not vulnerable. Solr also has a \"hadoop-auth\" module that uses Apache Hadoop which uses commons-text through commons-configuration2. For Solr, the concern is limited to loading Hadoop configuration files that would only ever be provided by trusted administrators, not externally (untrusted)."
