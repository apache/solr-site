    "detail": "Apache Calcite has a vulnerability, CVE-2022-39135, that is exploitable in Apache Solr in SolrCloud mode. If an untrusted user can supply SQL queries to Solr's '/sql' handler (even indirectly via proxies / other apps), then the user could perform an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This might have been exposed by some deployers of Solr in order for internal analysts to use JDBC based tooling, but would have unlikely been granted to wider audiences."
