  ],

    "jdom-*.jar"
  ],
  "analysis": {
    "state": "not_affected",
    "detail": "JDOM is only used in Solr Cell, which should not be used in production which makes the vulnerability unexploitable. It is a dependency of Apache Tika, which has analyzed the issue and determined the vulnerability is limited to two libraries not commonly used in search applications, see TIKA-3488 for details. Since Tika should be used outside of Solr, use a version of Tika which updates the affected libraries if concerned about exposure to this issue."
